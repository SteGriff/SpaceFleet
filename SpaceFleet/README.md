# Space Fleet

(Working title, considering "Hapless Galaxy", or "Unreasonable Space Conquest")

This is a cheap, tongue-in-cheek console game, drawing on Galactic Civilizations II. It's a simplified 4X game of taking over the galaxy by force. It features/will feature ship and planet management, tech research, space battles, and more. The aim is to rid the galaxy of everyone but yourself... I suppose.

I started writing this on my breaks at KGV College when I was 17, and rediscovered it this year. So I've been working on it, on and off, from 2011. We wrote VB.Net at College, so... sorry about that. But switching languages often keeps you mentally nimble :)
